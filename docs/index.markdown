# A Lightweight BSS Model Toolkit For PyTorch
Auralflow is an all-in-one **blind source separation (BSS)** (also known as
**music source separation**) package designed for PyTorch
integration. It offers ready-to-go, pretrained DL models capable of separating
music tracks into multiple sources: vocals, bass, drums and other. Auralflow
also provides customizable base model architectures, which can be trained
natively in auralflow or ported to your own custom training pipeline.
Several convenient training, audio processing, visualization
and evaluation tools are available for a more seamless and efficient workflow.
