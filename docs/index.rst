Auralflow Documentation
=======================

*Auralflow* is a lightweight deep learning toolkit for designing and training
music source separation models in PyTorch with minimal code. With highly
customizable base model architectures and an array of useful tools
— including audio processors, trainers, evaluators and visualizers — auralflow
offers a seamless and efficient ML workflow for training and evaluating music
source separation models.

Moreover, models can be trained
entirely with features native to the package or ported to custom training
scripts for more versatility. Lastly, auralflow sports downloadable,
pretrained neural networks that split full music tracks into vocals, bass,
drums and background instrumental tracks with quality results.
