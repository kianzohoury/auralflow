Auralflow Documentation
=======================

Auralflow is a lightweight deep learning toolkit for designing and training
music source separation models in PyTorch with minimal code. With highly
customizable base model architectures and an array of useful tools
— including audio processors, trainers, evaluators and visualizers — auralflow
offers a seamless and efficient ML workflow. Moreover, models can be trained
entirely with features native to the package or ported to custom training
scripts for more versatility. Lastly, auralflow sports ready-to-go,
pretrained neural networks that split full music tracks into
vocals, bass, drums and background instrumental tracks with quality results.
